According to WHO (<a href='https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports'>Situation report 13</a>, 2 Feb 2020), <i>the 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive ‘infodemic’ - an over-abundance of information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.</i><br>The <a href='https://comunelab.fbk.eu/'>Complex Multilayer Networks (CoMuNe) Lab</a>, <a href='https://www.fbk.eu/en/'>FBK</a>’s Research Unit for the analysis of Complex Systems in response to “shocks”, in collaboration with the <a href='https://cyber.harvard.edu/'>Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society</a> and <a href='https://www.iulm.it/en/home'>IULM University of Milan</a, reports the analysis of massive human activity in the online social platform <a href='https://twitter.com/home'>Twitter</a>."

Specifically, we used machine learning techniques to quantify: <ul><li><b>COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT & PSYCHOLOGY: </b>lexicon-based and rule-based emotional and psychological state</li><li><b>SOCIAL BOT POLLUTION: </b>The fraction of activities due to social bots and the exposure of the Twitterverse to unreliable news</li><li><b>NEWS RELIABILITY: </b> the fraction of URLs pointing to reliable news and scientific sources</li></ul><br>The table below reports 3 out of the several measures we have developed to characterize the infodemics. Specifically, we show: (1) <b>Native Reliability</b> (ie, the news reliability calculated with respect to messages in the country's native language); (2) <b>Unv. Bot Pollution</b> (ie, the pollution due to unverified social bots); (3) <b></b> (ie, the exposure of users to messages from unverified social bots). In the table, the field <b>Tweets</b> denotes the average number of messages per day in a country."
