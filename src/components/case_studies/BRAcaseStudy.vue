      This note analyses the infodemic trends in Brazil in the Jan - Nov 2020 period.
      <br>
      Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the infodemic trends related to posts written in both Portuguese and other languages in the Brazilian territory as about 66% of tweets are written in the local languages. The infodemic profile might be very different in principle for contents in the local mother tongue and in the foreign language.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Coverage level: <u>High</u></b><br>
          An average of more than 40,000 tweets per day. Between 22nd Jan and 16th Nov 2020: 21.3 million tweets with self-declared location associated with Brazil, 4.2 million tweets contain URLs linking to news sources, of which 963,000 were successfully identified as either reliable or unreliable by crossing the URL domain with our database of news domain reliability, 655,000 of which were written in Portuguese.

        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Infodemic Risk: <u>Medium - Growing</u></b><br>
          A medium/high (66%) current value and a low/medium (29%) average value IRI during the period considered. The infodemic risk from an exposure perspective (how many users are potentially exposed to unreliable news?) is steadily growing in time from 11% (January) to a current value of 66% (November).
          <br>A low/medium dynIRI, a measure of the infodemic risk from social media engagement (how many users are observed propagating unreliable news?), which for Brazil fluctuates around an average of 39%, corresponding to the 90th percentile worldwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      The country has a medium/high infodemic risk in the period of observation, as the risk grows as the pandemic aggravates. The current medium/high value of IRI is mostly driven by influential verified accounts, which is however only partly endorsed by the twitter user base, as is suggested by the lower value of dynIRI.

      <PolicyText>
        The combination of high information flows and increasing risks makes of Brazil a country whose current infodemic profile is critical. Especially critical is the fact that misinformation is driven by verified accounts. Infodemic risk has to be monitored constantly because the situation might change quickly in a turbulent period such as in the middle of a pandemic crisis.
