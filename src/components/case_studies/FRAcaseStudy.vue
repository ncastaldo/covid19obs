      This note analyses the infodemic trends in france in the Jan - Nov 2020 period.
      <br>
      Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the infodemic trends related to posts written in both local and foreign languages in the country territory as about 63% of tweets are written in French. The infodemic profile might be very different in principle for contents in the local mother tongue and in the foreign language.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Coverage level: <u>High</u></b><br>
          An average of more than 62,000 tweets per day. Between 22nd Jan and 23rd Nov 2020: 19.2 million tweets with self-declared location associated with France, 3.1 million tweets contain URLs linking to news sources, of which 1,150,000 were successfully identified as either reliable or unreliable by crossing the URL domain with our database of news domain reliability, 725,000 of which were written in French.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Infodemic Risk: <u>Low</u></b><br>
          A low (1%) current and average value of IRI during the period considered. The infodemic risk from an exposure perspective (how many users are potentially exposed to unreliable news?) initially grew in time up to a level of 2% (March) and then dropped to the current value of 1% (November).
          <br>
          A low dynIRI, a measure of the infodemic risk from social media engagement (how many users are observed propagating unreliable news?), which for France fluctuates around an average of 24%, corresponding to the 33rd percentile worldwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      France represents a largely positive example in Western Europe. The country has a low infodemic risk in the period of observation. The value of dynIRI however highly exceeds the IRI, suggesting that misinformation is highly propagated by non-influencers, that are unverified users with a small following.

      <PolicyText>
        The combination of high information flows and low risks makes France an exemplary country whose current infodemic profile is not apparently critical. However, the fact that there is a high level of propagation of unreliable information from unverified users flags a potential criticality that could manifest itself during moments of crisis, and could cause a sudden increase of infodemic risk.
