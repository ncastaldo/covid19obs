      This note analyses the infodemic trends in Singapore in the Jan - Nov 2020 period.
      <br>
      Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the infodemic trends related to posts written in both local and foreign languages in the country territory as about 88% of tweets are written in one of the four official languages of Singapore (English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil). The infodemic profile might be very different in principle for contents in the different local mother tongues and in foreign languages.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Coverage level: <u>Medium</u></b><br>
          An average of more than 3,300 tweets per day. Between 22nd Jan and 23th Nov 2020: 986,000 tweets with self-declared location associated with Singapore, 260,000 tweets contain URLs linking to news sources, of which 132,000 were successfully identified as either reliable or unreliable by crossing the URL domain with our database of news domain reliability, 117,000 of which were written in Spanish.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Infodemic Risk: <u>Low</u></b><br>
          A low average IRI, measuring the infodemic risk from an exposure perspective (how many users are potentially exposed to unreliable news?) as 0.1%, a value which steadily dropped in time from 1% (January) stabilizing to  0.1% (November), the lowest value worldwide.
          <br>
          A low dynIRI, a measure of the infodemic risk from social media engagement (how many users are observed propagating unreliable news?), which for Indonesia fluctuates around an average of 14%, corresponding to the 2th percentile worldwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      The Infodemic in Singapore is the lowest in South-Eastern Asia and in the World. The country has a low infodemic risk during the period of observation, and moreover such risk declines as the pandemic aggravates. After an initial minor presence of misinformation associated partly with verified accounts, linked to a single verified account, spiInfodemic threats are currently not active in Singapore.
      <br>
      <br>
      <PolicyText>
        The combination of medium-sized information flows and negligible risks makes Singapore one of the currently lowest-risk countries in the world as far as infodemics are concerned, and our indicators do not flag any specific criticality that could emerge in this regard.
