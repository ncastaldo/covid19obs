      This note analyses the infodemic trends in Venezuela in the Jan - Nov 2020 period.
      <br>
      Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of the infodemic trends related to posts written in both local and foreign languages in the country territory as about 87% of tweets are written in Spanish. The infodemic profile might be very different in principle for contents in the local mother tongue and in the foreign language.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Coverage level: <u>High</u></b><br>
          An average of more than 48,000 tweets per day. Between 22nd Jan and 23th Nov 2020: 12.4 million tweets with self-declared location associated with Venezuela, 2.1 million tweets contain URLs linking to news sources, of which 509,000 were successfully identified as either reliable or unreliable by crossing the URL domain with our database of news domain reliability, 445,000 of which were written in Portuguese.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Infodemic Risk: <u>High</u></b><br>
          A high average value IRI during the period considered (83%). The infodemic risk from an exposure perspective (how many users are potentially exposed to unreliable news?) has been steadily above 80% but recently dropped reaching a minimum of 66% (October).
          <br>
          A high dynIRI, a measure of the infodemic risk from social media engagement (how many users are observed propagating unreliable news?), which for Venezuela fluctuates around an average of 80%, corresponding to the second worst country worldwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      The Infodemic in Venezuela, together with Peru, represent the worst countries both in Lationamerica and worldwide, according to our data. The country has a high infodemic risk in the period of observation, but the risk seems to be dropping to medium/high in the last two months. The current medium/high value of IRI is still largely driven by influential verified accounts, which appear to be fully endorsed by the twitter user base, as is suggested by the high value of dynIRI.

      <PolicyText>
        The combination of high information flows and high risks makes of Venezuela a country whose current infodemic profile is especially critical. Of particular concern is the fact that misinformation is driven by verified accounts. Infodemic risk has to be monitored constantly because the situation might quickly escalate in a turbulent period such as in the middle of a pandemic crisis.
